    
    What software did you use to create your data visualization?

     I used Python for data processing and visualization, specifically used the matplotlib library to create the bar charts and subplots

    > Who is your intended audience? 

     The intended audience includes environmental analysts, forestry management professionals, and policymakers.
     These individuals need to understand changes in forest coverage over time to make informed decisions about conservation and resource management.
    

    > What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization? 

     The visualization aims to highlight the distribution of forest types and their total area in hectares across three key years: 2000, 2010, and 2020. By using separate subplots for each year, the visualization emphasizes changes in forest area distributions over time.

    
    > What design principles (substantive, perceptual, aesthetic) did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply these principles? With what elements of your plots? 
     
      Substantive Principles: Focused on showing meaningful data by filtering for three specific years and forest types to emphasize trends over time. This ensures the visualization is relevant and informative.

      Aesthetic Principles: Chose an aesthetically pleasing layout with aligned subplots, a clear title, and labeled axes. Rotated x-axis labels for better readability.


    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization? 

      I ensured reproducibility by using Python, an open-source programming language, and documenting the code used for processing and visualization. 
      And by writing Writing modular and reusable code so the same analysis can be applied to updated datasets. If the tool were not reproducible, the analysis could become opaque or difficult to replicate, reducing trust and usability.
    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?  

      The visualizations were designed to be accessible by:

      Using clear, descriptive titles, labels, and legends.

      Avoiding overloading with excessive data points to maintain clarity.

      Selecting high-contrast colors (gray, dark green, light green) to ensure the plots are distinguishable even for individuals with color vision deficiencies.
    
    > Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization?  

       The visualization impacts communities engaged in environmental conservation, such as forestry management agencies, policymakers, and local communities dependent on forests.

       Additionally, it could inform researchers and educators focused on climate change and natural resource sustainability.
    
    > How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization? 

       I included only the SnapYr, Forest Type, and TotalArea columns, as these are most relevant to the analysis goal of showing forest area distribution over time. 
       Other columns, were excluded to avoid clutter and maintain focus on the key variables.
    
    > What ‘underwater labour’ contributed to your final data visualization product?

       Cleaning and filtering the dataset to focus on three key years.

       Grouping and aggregating the data to calculate total areas.

       Testing and fine-tuning the visualizations for clarity and aesthetic appeal.

       Debugging and iterating through multiple attempts to resolve issues like overlapping labels or unclear legends.
